# 1096-cycle split-alias leanISA construction

The complete `Submission.Certificate 1096` passes a clean local build, exact
challenge comparison, permitted-axiom checks and fresh Lean kernel replay.
The competition model and admission requirements are unchanged. Hosted
acceptance remains pending; local verification timing is close to the limit.

## Result and construction

The proved bound is `106 + 87 * 10 + 120 = 1096` cycles, compared with the complete
1110-cycle ancestor. Every completing run has 193 instructions and 976 execution
cycles before the unchanged 120-cycle public-boundary surcharge. The signature
still contains 42 disclosed 128-bit words and the full 128-bit nonce: 5504 bits.
The effective index has 127 bits. Code and memory have respectively 2^18 and
2^16 rows, totaling 327680.

The fourteen-cycle improvement is one fewer chain hash (ten cycles) and four
fewer ordinary instructions. It combines three changes:

1. A sharper linear security potential permits layer 85.
2. Mixed four-/five-child binding packets keep chains 10, 11, 36 and 41 internal
   to their group blocks. A zero-step internal child is read directly from the
   signature; a positive-step child is read from its computed top.
3. Unequal alias multiplicities within a cost band improve the distribution of
   accepted indices while respecting each actual block's ordinary-operation budget.

Eight binding groups replace the earlier nine. Their visible parent prefixes
are positive, so each accepted tuple binds its children. Hidden coordinates are
included in the full digit tuple and its injectivity proof, but are not assumed
to be positive binding parents. The graph is acyclic and covers all 42 tops.
The verifier uses 85 chain hashes, one index hash and one root hash.

## Exact counting, not an entropy approximation

A field code selects a tuple through disjoint contiguous intervals. An interval
length is the tuple's alias multiplicity. Two tuples of the same cost can have
different multiplicities; therefore cost alone is insufficient to identify a
security tier.

`SplitIntervals`, `SplitCodec` and `FourChildCodec` prove the actual aliases,
full tuple injectivity, visible-prefix positivity and class weights. The weight
of a full index class is the product of its local multiplicities. A sparse
multiplicative dynamic program counts raw indices jointly by cost and weight,
then selects the accepted cost window 22 through 85. This yields 440 exact
weight tiers, including the exceptional local multiplicities 496 and 144.
`SplitCount` links this calculation to all actual 127-bit effective indices;
`FourChildTier` links it to the security schedule. No floating-point estimate
is used in the certificate.

The numeric schedule uses exact outward rounding at precision 2^256.
Its linear security coefficient, normalized by 2^-127, is
`1094562261779 / 2^40`, approximately 0.995499. The fresh-index drift bound is
`2189121718849 / (2^40 * 2^127)`, no greater than twice that coefficient.
Rarest-cut signing still uses 2^19 trials. The research-model failure upper
bound is approximately 0.587825 times 2^-128; Lean checks the required inequality.

The linear argument jointly accounts for new classes and repeated classes.
These are disjoint cases, not two simultaneous costs. The nonce space is twice
the effective-index space, and every nonempty class has weight at least one.
The duplicate increment is paid within the same potential, allowing a constant
fresh-query drift. Hidden key generation, post-signing, second-preimage and
signing self-collision terms remain in the proof. The competition's security
definition and budget accounting are unchanged.

This is consistent with an information-theoretic design heuristic—allocate
limited index mass where it helps the exact objective—but is not an application
of a named Shannon or Bourbaki theorem. No optimality or lower bound is claimed.

## Machine proof

The affine-frame architecture of the 1110 ancestor is retained. A fixed field
base is chosen by finite polynomial avoidance; it depends only on the table,
not on an input, execution, committed image or oracle. Per-block affine frames
remove entry jumps, and a separate checksum guard excludes prologue re-entry.

Four-child packets use a tag and the actual validated length word as metadata.
Five-child packets use the extra child word and power metadata. Additional
polynomial constraints separate the length word from the needed powers.
`SplitDomains` and `AffineDomains` prove the resulting packet/domain separation.

Eight guaranteed positive binding hashes are deducted from the checksum.
The free seed is `g^sentinel / a^77 * a^s`; restoring the eight deductions
forces the full layer to equal 85. Shifted block costs can reach 16, while
initialized powers reach 14. The 845 blocks that need two checksum
multiplications execute and pay for both. Hint rewriting is restricted to
actual hint cells so it cannot rewrite these checksum operations.

The packed prefix ends at slot 250577; free blocks begin at 255615, leaving
5038 slots. There are 14820 raw group blocks. Group 7 has 996 live field codes;
the remaining 28 codes trap. The low raw bit of the first field is ignored by
the 127-bit abstract index but remains pinned by the complete 128-bit index tie.

`AffinePath`/`AffineCycles` cover every completing run and every permitted
memory size. `AffineValues`/`AffineSound` prove that an arbitrary completing
committed image implies acceptance. `AffineProver`, `AffineCells`,
`AffineHonestChain` and `AffineHonestPath` construct a faithful honest image,
including zero-step internal reads and both checksum multiplications.
`AffineFaithful` handles both verifier decisions.

## Validation and proof engineering

### Check-time engineering pass (2026-09-28)

The exported statements, the program, the tables and the claim are unchanged;
only proof terms and module structure were reworked so that the hosted sandbox
(build + lean4export + kernel replay under `RuntimeMaxSec=1200`) has margin.
GF(2^64) products certified by `decide +kernel` (about 10,500 of them, roughly
20 ms each in replay) were replaced by structural Bool/Nat-primitive checks
(`BF64Fast`, `GenOrderFast`); the serial `SplitDPStage*` dynamic-program chain was
replaced by a packed certificate (`SplitPack`, `SplitContraction`, `SplitDP`); the
length-power and log-value tables use `rfl`/linear Bool scans instead of
`decide`; and the `SplitNumeric`/`AffineCodec`/`FourChildTier` checks use
certified scans (`ListCert`). Measured on an idle host: clean build 203.5 s
(peak PSS 12.96 GB, was 423.7 s / 18.75 GB), Solution export 10.4 s (288 MB),
CheckExports replay 117.3 s of which kernel replay 74.6 s (was 743.2 s / 695.6 s).
An independent structural walk over the old and new lean4export closures of
`submission`, `certificate` and `seeded_rows` found 3656 constants in each and
no differences. These are local measurements, not a hosted verdict.


The complete certificate and seeded-row bound pass a clean build with no prior
submission artifacts (8968 jobs, 423.679 seconds). Exact comparison against the
rendered 1096 challenge and its primitive declarations passes. The exported
dependency audit and named-theorem audits use only `propext`, `Classical.choice`
and `Quot.sound`. A fresh, unchanged Lean kernel replay accepts all 62151
exported declarations: replay itself takes 695.624 seconds, and parsing,
comparison, axiom checking and replay together take 743.160 seconds including
the local process wrapper.

The measured required build/export/check stages total 1187.366 seconds
(19 minutes 47 seconds), leaving only about 13 seconds against the 20-minute
limit on this host. This is a sum of standalone local measurements, not an
official sandboxed end-to-end verdict; hosted timeout remains a material risk.
Peak sampled proportional memory is about 17.5 GiB during the parallel build
and 6.0 GiB during replay. These are PSS samples, not a hosted cgroup measurement.
Build output is 34036 bytes. Source hashes were unchanged through validation.

Large dynamic-program certificates must be split into serial modules and
bounded row checks: a monolithic check exceeded the hosted memory cap locally.
The last two profiles are composed algebraically and their cost-window sum is
transposed into seven coefficient-vector dot products against the stage-11 rows.
This avoids constructing the last two full matrices. The generic composition
and transposition identities and every resulting count are kernel checked.
The numeric schedule similarly uses a certified linear scan of tier masses;
the cached schedule is proved equal to the original for every index.
These transformations change proof representation, not the table, arithmetic,
security conditions or machine score.
Obsolete unreachable machine/research modules are archived outside the
submission; the admitted root contains the active dependency chain.

The official Linux verifier fails closed here because Landlock is unavailable.
No sandbox requirement is bypassed, and local development checks are not a
hosted verdict. Submission requests the official hosted check.

## Failed approaches and next work

Earlier 1094/sub-1095 candidates failed exact security checks; removing padding
alone did not suffice. Uniform alias multiplicities by cost restricted the
search unnecessarily. Rotating packets alone does not separate domains on
attacker-chosen child values. None of these failures is an impossibility proof.

Further savings must count every initialization, copy, extra multiplication,
jump, length check and boundary charge. Useful next targets are a joint search
over packet arity, internal-child placement and split aliases, followed by exact
security and code-size screening. A still-lower estimate is not a certificate.
